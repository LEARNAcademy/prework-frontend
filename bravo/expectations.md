Me (expect of the students):

- Accountability - understanding your responsibilities within a small group
- Understanding to yourself for not "knowing" everything
- Humility - you are not above the process
- Patience - in the process and in yourself, be a good partner and be patient with all team members
- Deadlines
- Under promise and over deliver
- Ask questions
- Still learning and solidify concepts from the curriculum

We:
- Make sure the we are on the same page with the MVP
- Honesty - with feedback and emotionally honest
- Treating each other respectfully, the golden rule
- Get the work done, don't accept incomplete work
- Communicate road blocks
- Equal distribution of work - even if that means working together
- Defining what done looks like
